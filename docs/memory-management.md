# Memory Management

Memory management is a multipart process with multiple layers:
- [Physical memory](physical-memory): manages allocation of physical memory (page frame alloc).
- [Virtual memory](virtual-memory): manages virtualization and protection of memory (paging).
- Memory allocation: allocates memory for processes (malloc, free).
