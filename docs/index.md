# Welcome to the Jazz!

## Motivation
Just a key-press and the PC boots up. Just a click and the music starts. Doesn't it fascinates you what went into making the PC usable? How happens what happens when you boot up?! My answers to these questions were yes, so here I am, making an OS just for the heck of it! Also, if you're wondering 'why the name Jazz?', the answer is 'I just liked the sound of it (pun intended).'
