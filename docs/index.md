# Welcome to the Jazz!

## Motivation
Just a key-press and the PC boots up. Just a click and the music starts. Doesn't it fascinate you what went into making the PC usable? How happens what happens when you boot up?! My answers to these questions were yes, so here I am, making an OS just for the heck of it!

Also, if you're wondering _Why the name Jazz?_, the answer is _I just liked the sound of it!_
