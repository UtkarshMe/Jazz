# Jazz
The starting of an OS!

## About the project
This is an OS being written from scratch just for understanding what the
computer really is! The whole development 'transcript' can be found in the
[wiki](https://github.com/UtkarshMe/Jazz/wiki). Although I am trying to
make it as elaborate as possible, it might not be complete. Also, it is
still unverified noob knowledge. Don't trust unless you verify. And if you
find an error, do report it.
