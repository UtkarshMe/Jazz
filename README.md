# Jazz
_Let's write an OS!_

## About the project
**Jazz** is an Operating System that I have decided to write from scratch as a proof of concept to understand the OS by doing.

## Documentation
Most of the documentation is inside individual files.
Apart from that, the development 'transcript' can be found [here](https://utkarshme.github.io/Jazz/).
Although I am trying to make it as elaborate as possible, it might not be complete.
Also, it is still unverified _n00b_ knowledge.
Don't trust unless you verify. And if you find an error, do report it.

## Todo
The todo/plan can be found [here](https://github.com/UtkarshMe/Jazz/blob/master/TODO).
